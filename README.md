 - - main goals : color formating the assignemtns 
 - - we want each assiment to have weight to it  aka a darker color Green to red coloring 
 - - formula for numbering of assigments (generally we will multiply the date to have more weigh)
 - -  we want to have the date serv as an expodential weight that by radical amount per day closing
 - - natrually  the assigment percentage will have a multiplyer (Date*(percenent of weight))
 - - color foramting is based on the number we get from that formula
